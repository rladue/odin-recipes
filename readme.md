This is the readme file for the Odin Project's recipe website lesson.

Once the HTML portion of the assignment is finished, I should have
demonstrated basic skills in HTML coding; including default page tags,
anchors, images and (un)ordered lists.

I believe in future lessons, this repo will be revisited as I learn CSS,
and more HTML coding practices.
